Welcome to my directory!
For each exercise, I will create a new directory containing python files for that exercise; 
add it to my repo and push to my fork on gitHub.*

**A little about me:**
- My interest in Python started when created a script that makes paying my student loans easier. :)
- By day, I work in Product @ Amazon (5+ years), by night I'm a wanna Python professor helping with UW Python classes.
